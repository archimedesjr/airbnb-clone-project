# üîê API Security
Security is a critical aspect of this project to ensure that user data, financial transactions, and system integrity are protected. The following measures are implemented across the backend to secure the APIs:

‚úÖ Authentication
Implementation: Token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Django Token Authentication.
Purpose: Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. Prevents unauthorized access to user profiles, bookings, and other sensitive operations.

‚úÖ Authorization
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC).
Purpose: Restricts access to specific resources based on user roles (e.g., admin, host, guest). This prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they don't own or aren't permitted to interact with.

‚úÖ Input Validation & Sanitization
Implementation: All incoming data is validated using serializers and forms.
Purpose: Prevents injection attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensures the integrity of the data stored in the system.

‚úÖ Rate Limiting & Throttling
Implementation: DRF's throttling mechanism.
Purpose: Protects the API from brute-force attacks and abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP over time.

‚úÖ HTTPS Enforcement
Implementation: SSL/TLS certificates in production.
Purpose: Encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server, protecting against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

‚úÖ Secure Payment Handling
Implementation: Payment processing is handled through secure third-party services.
Purpose: Ensures that financial data is not stored directly in our system, reducing risk and complying with PCI-DSS guidelines.

‚úÖ CORS Configuration
Implementation: CORS headers are configured to allow only trusted frontend origins.
Purpose: Prevents malicious websites from interacting with the API via cross-origin requests.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why API Security Matters
User Data Protection: Personal data like names, contact details, and payment information must be protected to maintain trust and comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
Booking and Payment Integrity: Securing booking endpoints ensures that transactions are valid, non-repudiable, and not duplicated or forged.
System Stability: Rate limiting and proper error handling ensure the platform remains reliable and is not overwhelmed by malicious or accidental overuse.
Preventing Unauthorized Access: Ensures only legitimate users interact with their own data or roles, especially important in multi-role systems like hosts and guests.

Security is not a one-time setup but an ongoing priority. We regularly update dependencies, monitor for vulnerabilities, and apply best practices throughout development and deployment.

# üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline
üß† What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Delivery). It is a development practice that enables teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably by automating the stages of software delivery.

1. Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically builds and tests code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.
   
2. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): Automatically deploys code to staging or production environments once it passes tests, reducing manual intervention and speeding up release cycles.
## üöÄ Importance of CI/CD in This Project
1. Faster Development: Automates testing and deployment, saving time and effort.
2. Improved Code Quality: Ensures that all code passes tests before being merged or deployed.
3. Early Bug Detection: CI checks catch bugs early in the development cycle.
4. Reliable Deployments: CD pipelines ensure consistent and error-free deployment of updates to the application.
5. Team Collaboration: Developers can work in parallel without worrying about breaking the main application.
   
## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
1. GitHub Actions: Automates the workflow for running tests, linting, and deploying the application on code push or pull requests.
2. Docker: Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments using containerized applications.
3. Docker Compose: Used to define and manage multi-container services (e.g., Django + PostgreSQL + Redis).
4. Heroku / Render / Railway (optional): For automatic deployment to cloud hosting platforms.
5. pytest / unittest: For running automated tests during the CI process.
6. Black / flake8: For code formatting and linting checks in CI.
7. With CI/CD in place, we ensure our Airbnb Clone backend remains robust, secure, and always production-ready.
